make sure if you are using models for the hugging face things to know:
1) must check your ram and gpu if more than 8 gb then you can use model of size 8-10 gb easily
2) if u have 8 gb or less u should use smaller versions(like i have 8 gb ram so i used gpt2 model) 
3) keep it in mind nlp tasks for 2-3 epochs can also get u out of memory so use google collab
